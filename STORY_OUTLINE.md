# Story Outline

## Premise
- The Groton plaza has been sold to developers and is scheduled for demolition in ninety days.
- The player returns home and reconnects with friends who decide to preserve the plaza by recording a collaborative farewell album.
- Each song captures the sounds, voices, and memories of a different space — exteriors, interiors, and late-night hangouts.

## Act Structure
1. **Act I – Reconnections (Exterior scenes)**
   - Meet the core friend group in the plaza, suburban forest, and pond sequences.
   - Learn that every unlocked song will anchor a “Last Night at the Plaza” listening party.
   - Establish the countdown via Leah/Kayla rumor mill and Clara’s town hall notes.

2. **Act II – Gathering Echoes (Interior scenes)**
   - Each shop owner/worker shares how the redevelopment impacts them.
   - Player collects ambient sounds and stories (new NPC conversations) to craft tracks.
   - Multiple perspectives reveal tension between “luxury rebrand” and authentic community memory.

3. **Act III – Assembly (Back alley + karaoke bar)**
   - Friends meet after hours to stitch tracks together.
   - Choice beats (who contributes, which sounds you captured) influence final playlist order.
   - Finale should feel like a communal vigil/festival rather than a protest.

## Interior Beats
- **Grumby’s:** Late-night workers (Leah & Theo) loop refrigeration hums and gossip about the countdown.
- **Grohos:** Tony chases investors while Nina hides the old sauce recipe and clandestine recordings.
- **Clothing Store:** Priya catalogs beloved items to inspire a “midnight fitting room” song.
- **Dry Cleaner:** Mr. Clean preserves story-filled garment tags for a stitched ballad.
- **Donut Galaxy:** Kayla organizes regulars into a sunrise choir.
- **Flower Shop:** Elli mixes cooler fans and chimes into a bloom track.
- **Civic/Spiritual spaces (Church, Town Hall, Colonial House):** Offer reflection spots and oral histories.
- **Utility spaces (Hospital, Industrial floor, Modern office, Graveyard):** Broaden the mixtape palette with unconventional textures.

## Recurring Motifs
- **Sound as Memory:** Every conversation hints at a texture the player can capture (machines, voices, ambience).
- **Countdown:** NPCs reference the 90-day timer, culminating in Act III.
- **Community Collaboration:** Characters invite the player to contribute synths, harmonies, or mixing help.
- **Hopeful Nostalgia:** Tone balances grief with excitement about creating something lasting together.

## Next Narrative Tasks
- Script exterior follow-up conversations that react to interior discoveries.
- Design the karaoke-bar “assembly” scene logic and UI for curating the farewell playlist.
- Decide how unlocked songs alter the finale visuals/audio.
- Track the demolition countdown in UI so the urgency is visible.
